# Starting Meditation TXT/MD

A modified version of the opinionated, minimalistic how-to guide for meditation started by [Mattis @ Lightly.io](https://github.com/lightly-io/starting-meditation). Both the original version, and this version are published under the [Creative Commons 4.0 Share Alike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The goal of this project is to provide a simple meditation guide in .txt and .md format so that anyone can easily add the guide to their blog or other types of websites. If you are a meditation guru, I'd love to hear any suggestions you have to make this guide better. Message me at [Ommist](https://omm.ist). You may also start your own version like I have done here, but please abide by the CC license.

## Instructions

1. Copy and paste either the .txt file or .md file (depending on the format needed) into your blog post or website code. 
2. Tweak as needed.
3. That's it.
